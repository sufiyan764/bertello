                    <h3>Method</h3>
                    <ul>
                       <li>Let pizza dough get to room temperature. If using Bertello Pizza Dough, divide dough ball in half, then form each half into a dough ball to make two 12" pizzas. Flour pizza dough and stretch into two circular shaped pizzas. Get dough thin enough so you can barely see light coming through the dough. If it's too thin, it could rip.</li>
                       <li>Preheat your Bertello Oven to a temp of 700-800 in the middle of the stone (800-900 in the very back of the stone) with the gas burner on high.</li>
                       <li>Flour your pizza peel, then place dough on top of pizza peel. You will build your pizza on the peel.</li>
                       <li>Remove shells from pistachios and crush into small pieces. Sprinkle crushed pistachios on top of your pizza.</li>
                       <li>rip off pieces of fresh mozzarella cheese and place them on top of the pizza.</li>
                       <li>sprinkle on shredded parmigiano reggiano cheese over the entire pizza</li>
                       <li>add smoked gouda cheese to the top of pizza.</li>
                       <li>add thin pieces of speck to pizza.</li>
                       <li>slice pear paper thin and add pieces to the top of pizza</li>
                       <li>Before you launch your pizza, turn the gas burner to low, add about 2 thick wood chunks or pieces of wood kindling to the back of the oven. Allow this to catch on fire, then launch your pizza into the oven. Rotate the pizza every 20 to 25 seconds at quarter rotations.</li>
                       <li>After cooking your pizza, add fresh arugula to the top</li>
