            <p class="howto">
                Preheating is a crucial step for achieving perfectly cooked pizza. Follow these steps:
                1. Choose Your Fuel: <br>
                &nbsp;○ For authentic wood-red avor, use small pieces of hardwood. <br>
                &nbsp;○ Charcoal provides consistent heat and pairs well with wood. <br>
                &nbsp;○ Gas offers quick preheating and easy temperature control. <br>
                2. Light the Fuel: <br>
                &nbsp;○ For wood/charcoal: Use a re starter or small kindling to ignite the fuel. Gradually add more as needed. <br>
                &nbsp;○ For gas: Open the propane valve, ignite the burner, and adjust the ame to the desired level. <br>
                3. Monitor the Temperature: <br>
                &nbsp;○ Allow the oven to preheat for 15-20 minutes. Use an infrared thermometer to check that the pizza stone surface reaches at least 750°F for optimal results. <br>

        <h2>Cooking Pizza in a Bertello Oven: Pro Tips</h2>
        <section class="intro">
            <p class="howto">
                1. Prepare Your Pizza: Stretch your dough into a 10-12 inch circle, add a thin layer of sauce, and top with fresh ingredients. Avoid overloading the pizza to prevent sogginess. <br>
                2. Use a Pizza Peel: Sprinkle the peel with our or semolina to prevent sticking. Transfer your pizza onto the peel before placing it in the oven. <br>
                3. Cook Your Pizza: Slide the pizza onto the preheated stone. Rotate it every 20-30 seconds to ensure even cooking. The high heat cooks pizzas in 90 seconds to 2 minutes. <br>
                4. Experiment with Flavors: Try different fuel combinations (e.g., wood and charcoal) for unique smoky flavors. Adjust the toppings to suit your taste preferences. <br>
